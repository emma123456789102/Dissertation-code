## 🚀 Project Overview
This project investigates **SpectrumAI**, a framework for applying data-intensive methods to large-scale datasets with a focus on **object-oriented programming practices**.  

The research explores how **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning models** can be optimized to handle high-dimensional and high-frequency data efficiently.  

**Key Objectives:**
- Develop scalable **data pipelines** for preprocessing and analysis.  
- Implement **object-oriented programming** techniques to ensure modularity and reusability.  
- Evaluate the performance of different **machine learning models** on spectrum-based datasets.  
- Build **visualizations** to support interpretability and decision-making.  

> 📈 The significance of this research lies in its potential applications in **data-intensive industries**, where the ability to process and analyze large volumes of data can directly support innovation and informed decision-making.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emma123456789102/Dissertation-code.git
   cd Dissertation-code
2. **python -m venv env**
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'env\Scripts\activate'
3.**install packages**
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Example workflow:

Place your dataset in data/raw/.

Run preprocessing scripts to generate cleaned data in data/processed/.

Use the analysis scripts to train models and generate results.

Visualize outcomes with the scripts in src/visualization/.

Expected outputs include:

Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score.

Generated plots stored in the results/ directory.
